# DimDimMuscu

DimDimMuscu is a gym app developed using React Native, Expo and Typescript.
It includes a variety of features to help gym-goers achieve their fitness goals.

## Introduction

This app was developed as a personal project to learn more about mobile development and to create a tool that would be
useful for gym enthusiasts like I am. The app provides a range of features that can help users in their gym journey,
such as features to track their progress, their weights or their calories.

## Technologies Used

The app is built using React Native, Expo and Typescript, which allow me to write code that is both performant and easy
to maintain. Plus, it can run on both Android and Apple devices.
