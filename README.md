## Description

This is a personal project I developed to learn more about mobile development using React Native and Typescript.
The application is a gym app with various features to help gym-goers achieve their fitness goals.

## Technologies Used

The app is built using React Native and Typescript, which allow me to write code that is both performant and easy to maintain. Plus, it can run on both Android and Apple devices.

## Features

[still wip]

- home page
- weight tracker page
- exercise list page
- PR (personal record) page
- Info page 

## Screenshots

## Next features

- Workout session page (gym)
- Picture of evolution (once a month to track evolution)
- Home workout

To improve:
- more tests
