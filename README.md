# DimDimMuscu

DimDimMuscu is a gym app developed using Rust for the BackEnd.
It includes a variety of features to help gym-goers achieve their fitness goals.

## Introduction

This app was developed as a personal project to learn more about rust / axum and to create a tool that would be
useful for gym enthusiasts like I am. The app provides a range of features that can help users in their gym journey.

## Technologies Used

The app is built using Rust and axum for the server part, which allow me to write code that is both performant and
secure.
